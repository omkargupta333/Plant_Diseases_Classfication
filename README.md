# Plant_Diseases_Classfication
Plant Diseases Classfication using Deep Learning Tensorflow
The project aims to develop a potato disease classification tool using deep learning techniques and deploy it as a web application using Streamlit. The tool allows users to upload images of potato plants affected by various diseases or in a healthy state. Upon image upload, the tool processes the image using a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify the potato's health condition into categories such as early blight, late blight, or healthy. It also provides a confidence score for the classification.

Additionally, the web application displays detailed information about the predicted class, including a description of the disease, management strategies, and an emoji representing the health status. The user interface is designed to be user-friendly, with an easy-to-use sidebar for uploading images and viewing the results in real-time.

Impact of the Project:

Early Disease Detection: The tool enables early detection of diseases in potato plants, allowing farmers and agricultural experts to take timely action to prevent widespread damage and yield loss.
Efficient Management: By providing detailed information about the predicted disease, including management strategies, the tool equips farmers with the knowledge to implement effective disease management practices, such as proper air circulation, watering techniques, and fungicide application.
Crop Yield Optimization: With timely disease detection and appropriate management strategies, farmers can optimize crop yields by minimizing the impact of diseases on potato plants. This can lead to increased productivity and profitability in potato farming.
Accessibility: The web-based nature of the tool makes it accessible to a wide range of users, including farmers, agricultural experts, researchers, and agricultural extension workers, regardless of their geographical location or technical expertise.
Overall, the project aims to empower stakeholders in the agricultural sector with a powerful tool for potato disease diagnosis and management, ultimately contributing to sustainable agriculture, food security, and economic development.
